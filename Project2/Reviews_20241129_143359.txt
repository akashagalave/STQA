Review: Been using this over a week.The claimed memory foam insole is okayish dk how long will it last. Definately not for heavy long distance walks, rough terrains much less for gym and running.Design wise sneaker is gr8 though the yellow patch at the quarter is dull/faded yellow not bright yellow as shown in pics. The Grey and white combination is classicü§åüèºFinishing could've been better though not much of an issue as I spotted one loose end of thread at the tongue which I trimmed quickly.Sizing for (06) was perfect.Built quality is sturdy for a sneaker at this price but not much gr8 crease resistance at front (depends on how well uh take care:)Packaging was mehh specially the boxüëéüèºConsidering the price it's a gr8 sneaker to look forward to ;)
