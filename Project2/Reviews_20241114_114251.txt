Review: Bought 🛒 a pair of size-8 after finding 🔍🧐 good ratings, great sales 💹 at a bargain price. After receiving a new ✨ neat and clean pair, I found some discomfort 😫😖 when wearing, but was unable to pin 📍 point the problem.The return/replace period was 10 days 🗓️, and it was only past ⌛ one month, that I was able to figure out that one shoe 👟 was size-7 mislabelled as size-8, and the other was Ok.Amazon customer service 📞 suggested me to contact the manufacturer 🏭 directly as it was out of the date range 📆 that Amazon could handle. So, in good faith, I neatly 🧹 packed the pair in a box 🎁, with a cover letter 💌 detailing the size mismatch problem and shipped ⛴️ it to the manufacturing company, since anyway the mismatching pair was of no use 🗑️🚮♻️ to me.After not hearing 🚫👂🏻 back from the company for nearly 2 months, I contacted them and told 📢 the whole story. I was shocked ⚡😳 when the company's customer service 🙈 person said "it is an Amazon product" and "we can't do anything ("hum kucch nahi kar saktey") 🙊.I thought the perspective customers should know and judge ⚖️ whether Asian Footwear, "an ISO 9001-2008 certified 🏅 company that has been working responsibly towards society & environment", could be trusted or not?And I want to ask Dhoni, the brand ambassador 🧑🏻‍🎓, the Padma Bhushan Awardee 🏆, our Lieutenant Colonel 🪖, that what's the right thing ✔️ for the brand to do - to continue to mint money 🤑💰 in your name and keep selling 1000s of shoes in each interval, or 🤔 to invest some time in honestly addressing legitimate flaws 💔😞, e.g., QC issues?
