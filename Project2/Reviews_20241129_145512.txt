Review: The material and quality of the shoes are excellent, and they're still going strong nearly a year in. The shoes are soft, comfortable, and durable. However, the one drawback is that the logo on the back tends to fold inward when putting them on, which can be quite irritating. Other than that, they've been reliable and perform well!

Review: I seldom write product reviews on Amazon. But this shoe rightfully deserves one. I was looking for a walking/running shoes on a budget. I purchased this for 750. I wasn't expecting much, just needed something to walk to work and back. But I was pleasantly surprised by the product. I got a size 10 and it was just perfect - not too tight or loose and just snuck in well. The shoes is super comfortable and long walks are just pleasant. There is no fatigue or heaviness. The shoes are very light weight with a very good insole. I do not know the durability of this shoe, it's yet to be seen. But so far it's just bang for the buck.
